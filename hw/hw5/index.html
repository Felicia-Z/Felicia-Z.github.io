                    <h2>Understanding Snowboard Measurements</h2>
                    Before we go too far. Let's learn what is the basic terms of a snowboard. 
                    There are two main types of snowboard measurements: size details and tech details.
                    Size details are most often used to describe the physical dimensions of a snowboard.<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Length</li>
                        <li>Waist Width</li>
                        <li>Nose Width, Tail Width & Taper</li>
                        <li>Sidecut Radius & Sidecut Depth</li>
                    </ul>
                    Snowboard measurements that are indicated with non-number attributes are mostly used to explain tech details.<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bend</li>
                        <li>Flex</li>
                        <li>Binding Size</li>
                        <li>Weight Range</li>
                    </ul>               
                </div>

                <p>It’s important to keep your preferred riding style in mind when choosing the length of your board. 
                    Freestyle-focused riders, for example, 
                    will gravitate towards shorter board lengths to cut down on weight and make it easier to pull off tricks. 
                    They also don’t need extra edge hold or stability since they’ll mostly be riding at moderate speeds and on intermediate resort runs. 
                    On the flip side, many freeride-focused riders will want a longer board to provide more edge hold, 
                    float and stability in steeper terrain and a variety of snow conditions.<br>
                    If you’re just starting out and are looking for a more All Mountain board for all-around riding, 
                    check out the size chart on the left to help choose the snowboard length range that’s right for you.

                <p>The main reason you want to define your snowboarding style is for equipment choices. 
                Your board, binding and boot choices in particular will be largely influenced by what your "style" is.
                I put snowboards into five categories to help you find the right type of board for the style of snowboarding you do:

            <h2>Snowboard Camber and Rocker Profile</h2>
            <!-- copied from Burton.com -->
            <p>When we talk about a snowboard bend, we are referring to how it looks from the side (its profile). 
            In general, a snowboard profile will have at least one of the following bends: rocker, camber, or flat. 
            However, it is important to note that modern snowboards may include more than one type of profile. 
            This multi-bend construction is called a hybrid profile. 
            And while there are several factors that impact how a snowboard performs (sidecut, flex, taper, effective edge, nose/tail radius, shape, et cetera), board bend is one of the most important.<br> 
            Below are several common types of snowboard bends.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Camber Snowboards</li>
                <li>Rocker Snowboards</li>
                <li>Flat Snowboards</li>
                <li>Hybrid Camber Snowboards</li>
                <li>Hybrid Rocker Snowboards</li>
                <li>Directional Camber Snowboards</li>
            </ol>

                        A Camber snowboard has an upward curve between the feet. 
                        When depressed or flexed, 
                        this profile “snaps” back to its original shape generating energy that can be used to hold an edge.<br>

                            <li>Aggressive riders generally prefer camber boards for high-speed carving and the “poppy” feeling of linking turns.</li>
                            <li>Park riders often like camber snowboards, as the profile provides a high degree of edge control and a snappy flex for precise maneuvers on jumps, halfpipe walls, and even jibs.</li>

                        This profile causes the sidecut of the board to depress fully when the rider is up on-edge, 
                        allowing deep elbow-dragging carves. 
                        Rocker snowboards are often described as loose and playful, 
                        since the boards are already curved and don’t carry as much loaded energy between transitions.

                        A hybrid rocker snowboard is a hybrid board bend that has rocker between the feet and small sections of camber underneath the feet. 
                        The rocker in this profile makes the board loose and lifts up the nose and tail while the camber under the feet provides extra edge grip on hardpacked conditions.<br>

                There are a large number of variations of each shape type available but all of those shapes should fit somewhere in the following broad categories:

                    <h3>True Twin</h3>
                    <p>A true twin shape is completely symmetrical. 
                        If you cut a true twin in half exactly down the middle you would end up with two identical pieces of board.<br>
                        <br>
                        This means that the:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Nose and the tail are the same length and width</li>
                            <li>Bindings are typically centered on the board, meaning:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The distance from the center of the front binding to the contact point at the nose of the board 
                                        is the same as the distance from the center of the back binding to the contact point on the tail of the board 
                                        (this is often referred to as centered on the effective edge)</li>
                                    <li>In the case of true twins it’s also true that the waist (center) of the board 
                                        is equal distance to the very tip of the nose and the very tip of the tail 
                                        – since the nose and tail are both the same length</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>A true twin has exactly the same flex in the nose and tail</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>Who Rides True Twin?</h4>
                        True Twin boards are most suited to Freestyle and All-Mountain-Freestyle riders.

                    <h3>Asymmetrical Twin</h3>
                    <p>A common variation on the true twin is the asymmetrical twin (asym). 
                        Asym twins are designed to give you a more similar feel turning no both your heel edge and toe edge. 
                        There are 3 ways that a board can be asymmetrical:
                        <ol>

                        <br>
                        A directional board will usually have a number of things that make it directional, 
                        which could be some or all of the following – but needs to be more directional oriented than a directional twin:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Longer nose than tail (always)</li>
                            <li>Different shaped nose and tail (sometimes)</li>
                            <li>A setback stance (a majority of the time)</li>
                            <li>A directional sidecut</li>
                            <li>A directional camber profile (often)</li>
                            <li>Directional flex pattern (different flex in and towards the tail vs in and towards the nose)</li>

                        <h4>Who Rides True Twin?</h4>
                        Directional boards are mostly used for all-mountain riders and freeriders. 
                        Most, if not all, of the time you will be riding in one direction. 
                        And the board is optimized to make riding in one-direction better – particularly for carving, speed and powder.

                    <h3>Directional Twin</h3>
                    <p>The directional twin at first glance can appears to be a true twin but is subtly directional.
                        Inside the contact points a directional twin is a twin (hence the “twin” in the name) 
                        – but outside the contact points the nose is a little longer than the tail 
                        – but the width at the contact points will be the same.
                        And then there’s usually setback stance (setback along the effective edge). <br>
                        <br> 
                        A directional twin is usually labelled as such when:
                        <ol>
                            <li>It has a setback stance – but usually no more than 20mm (3/4″)</li>
                            <li>Has a nose that is slightly longer than the tail</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>Who Rides Directional Twin?</h4>
                        A directional twin board is generally suited to anyone riding all-mountain-freestyle or all-mountain. 
                            It won’t be quite as comfortable riding switch but will still be able to handle switch fine.

                    <h3>Tapered Directional</h3>
                    <p>A tapered directional shape is like a directional shape but with one major difference 
                        – the width of the widest point of the nose (contact point) 
                        will be wider than the width of the widest point (contact point) on the tail.<br>
                        <br>
                        Often on a board with a tapered directional shape everything about the nose and the tail is different, including:
                        <ol>
                            <li>A wider nose than tail (tapered shape)</li>
                            <li>A longer nose – often significantly longer</li>
                            <li>Flex – the tail is often stiffer than the nose, to promote the tail to sink and the nose to float</li>
                            <li>Shape</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>Who Rides Tapered Directional?</h4>
                        This one is definitely all about the freeriders and those who want a powder specialist board. 
                        A tapered directional shape is usually designed to provide the best float in powder – promoting the tail to sink and the nose to rise. 
                        And can also be good for maneuverability in the trees – with a short flicky tail you can kick around.

                        <li>Torsional flex is the flex width ways (from edge to edge). 
                        This is generally not considered by people when deciding on their snowboard purchase

                <p><b>Beginner Level 3:</b>You can now link turns in both directions (i.e. from your heel edge to your toe edge and your toe edge to your heel edge) on gentle slopes. Your turns are probably C shape turns at this point. You might be branching out into the intermediate runs but not so comfortable linking turns on those yet.

                <p>You might be trying little natural jumps or small jumps in the park, if that interests you - and you're starting to learn how to ride switch.  </p>
                    
                <p>You might be starting to try some carving and your S turns are getting smoother - you still skid them sometimes, especially on steeper terrain, but at times you are getting cleaner lines. And on powder days, you might be starting to explore off the groomer.</p> 
                
                <p><b>Intermediate Level 6:</b>You can now link turns at reasonably high speeds and on steeper slopes. Your technique is smoother and you can ride black runs with a fair level of comfort. You are very confident and comfortable bombing intermediate runs.</p>
                    
                <p>You may also be venturing off groomer, quite a bit more, including trees (off piste).</p>
                    
                <p>Your turns are becoming smoother (not at the stage of never skidding, but skidding is becoming less frequent). You can stop on a dime when needed, and can turn sharply when needed. You are starting to learn other types of turns, like down-unweighted turns and proper carves. </p>
                    
                <p>If you are leaning towards freestyle riding, then your switch riding is getting smoother. You can comfortably do ollies and are confident on small to medium jumps. You might be 50/50 or board sliding boxes, and maybe even a pipe or rail. You can do 180s confidently or are on your way to doing them and might be attempting larger rotations.  You probably have at least one grab in your repertoire. And you might be trying out the pipe. </p>

            <div id="LAdvanced" class="tab2content">
                <p> <b>Advanced Level 7:</b>You are now a very confident snowboarder who can tackle almost any terrain on and off groomer (piste). You might be starting to do backcountry excursions too, if that interests you. </p>

                <p> You are comfortable riding and turning at speed. You have mastered multiple turn types - including carving & down unweighted turns - and leave thin clean lines behind you. Riding switch has become second nature too. </p>
                    
                <p> If you are park inclined, then small to medium jumps with smooth confident 180s & 360s are in your bag of tricks for sure (and larger rotations are coming in, if that interests you). Large jumps are no problem for you now too - whether you might be just straight airing them - or performing spins. You probably have multiple grabs that you are comfortable performing. </p>
                    
                <p> You can confidently ride larger rails and pipes and are getting more technical on them - like 180s onto and off, tail and nose presses etc.  </p>
                    
                <p> You can, and often do, use the mountain like a park if you are so inclined.</p>

            <div id="LExpert" class="tab2content">
                <p> <b>Expert Level 8+:</b>Depending on your chosen style:</p>

                <p> <b>Freeriding:</b> You can bomb any slope, chute, bowl, you name it, and are confident on any terrain. On backcountry excursions you are finding more and more challenging terrain, hucking cliffs and you have a fluidity, flow and cleanness to your riding. All turn types are mastered and you can adapt to any situation.  </p>
                    
                <p> <b>Freestyle:</b> Large to XL jumps with 180s, 360s, 540s and larger rotations. Taking off and landing switch is no issue. Inverted aerials might now be in your realm too. On rails, boxes, pipes etc - you are creative and confident. Using multiple tricks and creativity on natural features too. </p>
                    
                <p>As an expert level rider, there’s still always room to improve of course, but you have mastered snowboarding and your board has become an extension of your body.</p>
