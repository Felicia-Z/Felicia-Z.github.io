Individual project #1 


Overview

This is a project for ARTG5430 35522 Visualization Technologies 2 SEC 02 Spring 2023 [BOS-2-TR]. I will keep adding more content to this project as the semester goes on.  

Currently I only have the knowledge that learned from Vis Tech 1. And I am not really a art person. Let's see how much progression in both technical skills and taste of art that I can make after this semester. 


Homework

Week 1: Assignment 1 (A1): Visualizing through Sketching

        1) This weeks goal is to set up the homepage with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        2) Add an image that is meaningful to me.
        3) Dataset:  

            Question:  

                I would like to visualize the population distribution structure change from 1900 and 2000 data.  

            Sketch:     

                a) The goal for this sketch is to compare the population changes in all age groups in 1900 and 2000.  

                Visualization: First, redefine and merge age groups into 4 large groups which is 0-14 children, 15-25 youth, 25- 65 adult, 65+ senior. The bigger the image, the larger the population. It is possible to put 1900 and 2000 data on one sketch because of the less data point. It is ok to change new age groups depending on each country's standard. You can easily tell that the population structure is getting better. In 1900, most of the population were children, while in 2000 most of the population were adults.   

                b) The goal for second sketch is to compare male vs female population in the same year.  

                Visualization: Use horizontal histogram to create a pyramid.  

                As we can see from the sketch, in 1990, it was almost 1:1 in all age groups. In 2000, it was obvious that there were more male before 30, and there are more female after 30, the difference got bigger when age went up higher. It is rational to think that in 2000, the medical conditions were far better than 1900, the expected life went up a lot. Although there was more man lived longer, women still live longer than man. 

                c)The goal for the third sketch is to compare 1900 male population vs 2000 male population, 1900 female population vs 2000 female population.  

                Visualization: Use poly lines in different colors to represent the population. I was thinking about adding an increase percentage bar under each data point, but almost every data point has an over 200% increase rate, and I think this will draw too much users' attention to it.  

            Comparison: 

                a) What are their strengths and weaknesses?  

                b) What new directions might you explore (e.g., synthesizing elements from every sketch, or describing why one of them is significantly better than the others?). 

                Sketch 1: It is very straight forward to see the population growth from 1900 to 2000 in each age group, especially in adult group. However, the cons for the first design are that it merged all the data into 4 larger groups. In this case, the prototype might be too general and too low-fi. It is hard to distinguish the data for specific ages. The scale of the image is kind of wield too. For example, there are more children than youth age group, so the children image is larger than youth image.   

                Sketch 2: The second sketch would like to convey the male to female ratio in each year in which we might find some interesting fact that although there are more male at a younger age range, females tend to live longer than male. The pyramid shape can also represent data in a very straight forward way, and we can tell how the structure changed over years. Using blue and red to represent male and female, combined with the histogram shape, will leave a visual impression for the users. From the data we can tell infant death rate gets lower obviously because the population of adults remains almost the same as children in 2000. It is also possible to add a feature that users hover the mouse on the bar to see the exact number to increase interactivity.   

                Sketch 3: The third sketch use a polyline to visualize the population change among same sex group. The strength of this sketch is that it looks clean, simple while it remains functional.
