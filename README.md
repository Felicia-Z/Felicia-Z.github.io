Individual project #1 


Overview

This is a project for ARTG5430 35522 Visualization Technologies 2 SEC 02 Spring 2023 [BOS-2-TR]. I will keep adding more content to this project as the semester goes on.  

Currently I only have the knowledge that learned from Vis Tech 1. And I am not really a art person. Let's see how much progression in both technical skills and taste of art that I can make after this semester.

        1) This weeks goal is to set up the homepage with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
