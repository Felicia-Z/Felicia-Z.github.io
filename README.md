Individual project #1 


Overview

This is a project for ARTG5430 35522 Visualization Technologies 2 SEC 02 Spring 2023 [BOS-2-TR]. I will keep adding more content to this project as the semester goes on.  

Currently I only have the knowledge that learned from Vis Tech 1. And I am not really a art person. Let's see how much progression in both technical skills and taste of art that I can make after this semester. 


Homework

Week 1: Assignment 1 (A1): Visualizing through Sketching

        1) This weeks goal is to set up the homepage with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        2) Add an image that is meaningful to me.
        3) Dataset: 
            Question: 
                I would like to visualize the population distribution structure change from 1900 and 2000 data. 
            Sketch:    
                a) The goal for this sketch is to compare the population changes in all age groups in 1900 and 2000. 
                Visualization: First, redefine and merge age groups into 4 large groups which is 0-14 children, 15-25 youth, 25- 65 adult, 65+ senior. Tthe bigger the image, the larger the population. It is possible to put 1900 and 2000 data on one sketch because of the less data point. It is ok to change new age groups depends on each country's standard. You can easily tell that the population structure is getting better. In 1900, most population were children, while in 2000 most population were adult.  
                b) The goal for second sketch is to compale male vs female population in the same year. 
                Visulization: Use horizontal histogram to create a pyramid. 
                As we can see from the sketch, in 1990, it was almost 1:1 in all age groups. In 2000, it was obvious that there were more male before 30, and there are more female after 30, the difference got bigger when age went up higher. It is rational to think that in 2000, the medical conditions were far more better than 1900, the expected life went up a lot. Although there were more man lived longer, women still live longer than man.
                c)The goal fot the third sketch is to compare 1900 male population vs 2000 male population, 1900 female population vs 2000 female population. 
                Visualization: Use poly line in different color to represent the population. Add a increase percentage under each data point.
            Comparison:
                a)what are their strengths and weaknesses? 
                b)What new directions might you explore (e.g., synthesizing elements from every sketch, or describing why one of them is significantly better than the others?).
                It is very straight forward to see the population growth from 1900 to 2000 in each age group, especially in adult group. However, the cons for the first design is that it merged all the data into 4 larger groups. In this case, the prototype might be too general and too low-fi. It is hard to distinguish the data for specific age group.  
                The second sketch would like to convey the male to female ratio in each year in which we might find some interesting fact that although there are more male at a younger age range, females tend to live longer than male.
