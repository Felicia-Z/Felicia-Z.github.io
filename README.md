You can find my final project through a link on my homepage, or you could go to my final project 
by the following URL:https://felicia-z.github.io/hw/hw5/ 

The goal of my final project is to help the viewers with limited snowboarding experience understand the factors for choosing the RIGHT snowboard. Also, because of the poor snow condition in the new England area, the other goal is to help experienced riders pick a snowboard that is best for powder condition.
