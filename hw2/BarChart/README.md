Assignment 2 (A2): Visualization Design
Part 1 Demonstrations and QA
Choose one of the two demonstrations given under Files -> Demonstrations -> gapminder_demonstrations.zip (scatter plot or bar chart). Only a .js file is provided for each demonstration, and each file uses the gapminder.csv dataset that is under Files -> Datasets. Throughout the two JavaScript files, you'll find a series of conceptual questions that ask you to explain what is happening in the code. 

(1) Work through the questions inside your chosen demonstration, and record your answers directly in the file in the commented sections. 

(2) Create an html file and load the appropriate datasets, stylesheets, and scripts to create the expected visualization. Submit a complete copy of your code (zip folder) and a screenshot of your resulting chart to Canvas.

(3) Open the opposite demonstration's js file (e.g., if you studied the scatter plot, find the bar chart and vice versa). Without implementing the visualization, study its various parts and pay attention to what is similar and what is different between the two. In particular:

(a) What kinds of scale functions are used in both demonstrations? Why are those scale functions being used?
(b) What is similar and different about the data join pattern used in both demonstrations?
(c) Compare the ways the data are filtered in both demonstrations. How are these different?
(d) If you wanted to convert the bar chart to the scatter plot or vice versa, what changes would you need to make to the code to make that conversion? 

Record your answers in a separate document (e.g., a PDF file) and upload the document to Canvas.
