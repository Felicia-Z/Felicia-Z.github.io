Part 2 Exercise in Exploratory Analysis

STEP 1

Choose a topic area of interest to you and find a dataset that can provide insights into that topic. 

three different questions you’d like to investigate in relation to the topic and dataset

STEP 2

Use any visualization tool/method you are most comfortable with (digital or physical, or both) to explore your dataset. 

(1)  First, gain an overview of the shape and structure of your dataset

     - Who collected/produced this dataset and why? Is it recent, is it being frequently updated?     

     - Are there any data quality issues? For example, is there anything missing?

     - What variables does the dataset contain? What do they stand for? Can you tell how the variables are distributed?
     
     - Are there any notable relationships between the variables?

(2) investigate your initial questions.

    For each question, start by creating a visualization that might provide a useful answer. 

    Refine your question and your visualization as needed

    (e.g., add new variables, change sorting or axis scales, transform your data by filtering it). 

Deliverable

Your final submission should be a single PDF report that consists of 6-9 captioned visualizations summarizing your most important insights about the dataset of your choice.

Each visualization image should be a screenshot exported from a visualization tool, accompanied with a title and descriptive caption (2-4 sentences long) describing the insight(s) learned from that view. 

 Your “insights” can include important surprises or issues (such as data quality problems affecting your analysis) as well as responses to your analysis questions.
